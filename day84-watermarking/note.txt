----------------------------
Using what you have learnt about Tkinter, you will create a desktop application with a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) where you can upload an image and use Python to add a watermark logo/text.
Normally, you would have to use an image editing software like Photoshop to add the watermark,
but your program is going to do it automatically.

Use case: e.g you want to start posting your photos to Instagram but you want to add your website
to all the photos, you can now use your software to add your website/logo automatically to any image.

and some Googling.
